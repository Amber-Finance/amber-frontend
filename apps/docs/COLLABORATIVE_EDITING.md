# Collaborative Editing System

This documentation site now includes a wallet-based collaborative editing system that allows approved contributors to suggest changes to the documentation.

## Features

### üîê Wallet Authentication
- Connect with any Cosmos wallet (Keplr, Leap, Cosmostation, etc.)
- Cryptographic signature verification for all actions
- Transparent user identification via wallet addresses

### üìù Edit Proposals
- Submit edit proposals with side-by-side diff view
- All proposals are cryptographically signed
- Proposals include original and proposed content
- Timestamped and attributed to specific wallet addresses

### üë• Permission System
- **Viewers**: Can read documentation (all connected users)
- **Approved Contributors**: Can submit edit proposals
- **Admins**: Can approve/reject proposals and manage the system

### üîç Review Process
- Admins can review all pending proposals
- Side-by-side comparison of original vs proposed content
- One-click approve/reject with cryptographic signatures
- Complete audit trail of all changes

## Setup

### 1. Configure Approved Contributors

Edit `apps/docs/src/components/common/ConnectButton.tsx` and add wallet addresses:

```typescript
const APPROVED_CONTRIBUTORS = [
  'neutron1...', // Add Gizhib's address
  'neutron1...', // Add other approved contributors
]

const ADMIN_ADDRESSES = [
  'neutron1...', // Add Gizhib's address for admin access
]
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Add to your `.env.local`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your-walletconnect-project-id
```

### 3. Backend Integration (Future)

Currently, the system stores proposals in memory. For production, you'll want to:

1. **Database Storage**: Store proposals in a database
2. **File System Integration**: Automatically apply approved changes to MDX files
3. **Git Integration**: Create pull requests for approved changes
4. **Notification System**: Alert admins of new proposals

## Usage

### For Contributors

1. **Connect Wallet**: Click "Connect Wallet" in the navbar
2. **Submit Proposal**: Click "Suggest Edit" in the user menu
3. **Edit Content**: Make your changes in the side-by-side editor
4. **Sign & Submit**: Sign the proposal with your wallet
5. **Wait for Review**: Admins will review your proposal

### For Admins

1. **Connect Wallet**: Use an admin wallet address
2. **Review Proposals**: Click "Review Changes" to see pending proposals
3. **Approve/Reject**: Review each proposal and approve or reject
4. **Apply Changes**: Approved changes can be automatically applied

## Security Features

- **Cryptographic Signatures**: All actions require wallet signatures
- **Address Verification**: Only approved addresses can submit proposals
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of who proposed what changes
- **Permission Levels**: Granular control over who can do what

## Technical Architecture

### Components

- `CosmosKitProvider`: Wallet connection and chain configuration
- `CollaborativeEditingProvider`: State management for proposals
- `ConnectButton`: Main wallet connection interface
- `EditProposalModal`: Interface for submitting proposals
- `ReviewProposalsModal`: Admin interface for reviewing proposals

### Data Flow

1. User connects wallet ‚Üí Address verified against approved list
2. User submits proposal ‚Üí Content signed with wallet
3. Proposal stored in context ‚Üí Available for admin review
4. Admin reviews proposal ‚Üí Approves/rejects with signature
5. Approved changes ‚Üí Can be applied to file system

## Future Enhancements

- **Real-time Collaboration**: Live editing with multiple users
- **Version Control**: Git integration for change tracking
- **Comment System**: Discussion on specific proposals
- **Automated Testing**: Validate changes before approval
- **Notification System**: Email/Discord alerts for new proposals
- **Bounty System**: Reward contributors for accepted changes

## Development

### Running Locally

```bash
cd apps/docs
pnpm dev
```

### Testing the System

1. Connect with a test wallet
2. Add the wallet address to `APPROVED_CONTRIBUTORS`
3. Submit a test proposal
4. Connect with an admin wallet to review

### Customization

- Modify the permission system in `ConnectButton.tsx`
- Customize the UI in the modal components
- Add new features to the collaborative editing context
- Integrate with your preferred backend system

## Security Considerations

- Always verify wallet signatures on the backend
- Implement rate limiting for proposal submissions
- Consider implementing proposal expiration
- Add content validation to prevent malicious proposals
- Regular backup of proposal data

This system provides a foundation for community-driven documentation while maintaining security and quality control through cryptographic verification and admin oversight.
