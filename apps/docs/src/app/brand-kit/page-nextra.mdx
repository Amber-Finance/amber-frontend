To the extent that the Amber Finance Foundation or its contributors hold intellectual property rights in the Amber Designs, all such rights are licensed to the public under the **Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License** (the "License").

Under the License, you may — subject to its conditions:

### Notes on Logo Elements

If any Amber Finance logo incorporates third-party design elements, those elements are used under their respective licenses and will be documented in the Amber Design Kit. Some elements may require additional attribution or a separate license if you wish to use them independently.

### Usage Guidelines

- **Primary Logos**: Use the primary Amber Finance logos for official communications and branding
- **Logo Grids**: Logo grids provide multiple logo variations in a single file for easy reference and comparison
- **Icon Grids**: Icon grids contain icon variations and can be used for UI/UX design purposes
- **Partner Logos**: Partner logos should be used in accordance with their respective brand guidelines
- **Protocol Logos**: Protocol logos represent the underlying blockchain protocols and should be used appropriately in technical documentation
- **Format**: Prefer SVG formats for web use, PNG for print materials where transparency is needed
