## Amber Brand Policy

The Amber Finance name, marks, design elements, logos, and brand — including the name “Amber” — were created in collaboration between the Amber Finance Foundation and its design contributors.
A complete set of such intellectual property (collectively, the “Amber Designs”) is available in the **Amber Design Kit**.

The Amber Designs are **not trademarks or service marks** and are not intended to identify the source of any goods or services. They form part of the open, community-owned Amber commons, governed through rough social consensus and Amber Finance’s governance processes.

To the extent that the Amber Finance Foundation or its contributors hold intellectual property rights in the Amber Designs, all such rights are licensed to the public under the **Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License** (the “License”).

Under the License, you may — subject to its conditions:

* Reproduce and **Share** (as defined in the License) the Amber Designs, in whole or in part;
* Produce, reproduce, and Share any **Adapted Material** (as defined in the License, meaning any derivative or modified works based on the Amber Designs).
