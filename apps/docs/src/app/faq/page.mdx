## General Questions

### How do I get started with Amber Finance?

Start with our **[Getting Started guide](/user-guide/getting_started)** which covers:

- Connecting your wallet
- Understanding the platform
- Finding yield opportunities
- Next steps for depositing and strategies

### What is Amber Finance?

Amber Finance is a Bitcoin yield farming platform built on the Cosmos ecosystem. It enables Bitcoin holders to earn yields through liquid staking tokens (LSTs), leverage strategies, and protocol lending. Users can deposit Bitcoin Related Tokens (BRTs) like LBTC, solvBTC, uniBTC, and others to earn combined yields from both protocol lending and native staking rewards.

### How do I generate yield on Amber Finance?

You can generate yield through multiple strategies:

- **Depositing BRTs**: Earn Mars Fragments and Neutron Points while maintaining Bitcoin exposure
- **Looping strategies**: Amplify returns using leverage (see our [Looping BRTs guide](/user-guide/looping))
- **Protocol rewards**: Earn underlying staking rewards from BRT protocols

For detailed steps, see our **[Depositing BRTs guide](/user-guide/depositing)**.

### Is Amber Finance safe?

Amber Finance prioritizes security through:

- **Battle-tested smart contracts** with extensive audits
- **Health factor monitoring** to prevent liquidations
- **Diversified protocol exposure** to reduce single-point-of-failure risks
- **Transparent operations** on the Neutron blockchain

However, like all DeFi protocols, there are inherent risks including smart contract vulnerabilities, liquidation risks, and market volatility.

### What are the fees?

Amber Finance charges minimal fees:

- **No deposit/withdrawal fees** - only network gas costs
- **Protocol fees**: Small percentage of earned yields (typically 5-10%)
- **Gas fees**: Standard Neutron network fees (very low, usually less than $0.01)
- **No hidden fees** - all costs are transparent and displayed upfront

## Using the Platform

### How do I connect my wallet?

Amber Finance supports multiple Cosmos wallets including Keplr, Leap, Cosmostation, OKX Wallet, Vectis, and XDEFI.

For detailed connection steps, see our **[Getting Started guide](/user-guide/getting_started)**.

> **Tip:** Make sure you have some NTRN tokens for gas fees.

### How do I start earning yields?

1. **Browse the dashboard** and select a BRT token card
2. **Enter deposit amount** and confirm the transaction
3. **Start earning immediately** - yields are calculated in real-time

For detailed steps, see our **[Depositing BRTs guide](/user-guide/depositing)**.

### What is a health factor?

Health factor measures how close your position is to liquidation:

- **Above 2.0**: Very safe, can increase leverage
- **1.5 - 2.0**: Safe operating range
- **1.3 - 1.5**: Caution zone, monitor closely
- **1.2 - 1.3**: Danger zone, reduce leverage immediately
- **Below 1.2**: Liquidation risk, take immediate action

### How do leverage strategies work?

Leverage strategies use your deposited BRTs as collateral to borrow additional assets, amplifying your potential returns.

**Important**: Higher returns come with higher risks. Monitor your health factor closely.

For detailed information, see our **[Strategy Guide](/strategies)**.

## Strategies & Risk Management

### Which strategy should I choose?

Choose based on your experience and risk tolerance:

**Conservative** - For beginners:

- Start with simple deposits to understand the platform
- Focus on established protocols (LBTC, uniBTC)
- Learn about health factors and monitoring

**Balanced** - For experienced users:

- Explore looping strategies with moderate leverage
- Diversify across multiple BRTs
- Monitor health factors regularly

**Advanced** - For DeFi experts:

- Use looping strategies with higher leverage
- Implement complex yield optimization
- Maintain strict risk management

See our **[Strategy Guide](/strategies)** for detailed strategy information.

### How do I manage liquidation risk?

Prevent liquidations by:

1. **Maintaining healthy ratios** - Keep health factor above 1.5
2. **Diversifying collateral** - Don't put everything in one asset
3. **Monitoring regularly** - Check positions daily for high-leverage strategies
4. **Setting alerts** - Use notifications for health factor warnings
5. **Having reserves** - Keep extra assets to add as collateral if needed

### What happens if I get liquidated?

If your health factor drops below 1.0:

1. **Partial liquidation** occurs to bring you back to safety
2. **Liquidation penalty** is applied (typically 5-10%)
3. **Your debt is reduced** by the amount liquidated
4. **Remaining position** continues earning yields

To avoid liquidation, monitor your health factor and add collateral or reduce debt when it gets low.

### How does the swap feature work?

### How do I withdraw my assets?

To withdraw your deposited assets:

1. **Navigate to the specific token** page (e.g., LBTC)
2. **Switch to "Withdraw" tab**
3. **Enter withdrawal amount** or use percentage slider

## Troubleshooting

### My transaction failed, what should I do?

Common solutions for failed transactions:

1. **Check gas balance** - Ensure you have NTRN for fees
2. **Verify network** - Confirm you're connected to Neutron
3. **Refresh the page** - Clear any cached data
4. **Increase gas limit** - Some complex transactions need more gas
5. **Try again** - Network congestion can cause temporary failures

### I can't see my balance after depositing

If your balance doesn't appear:

1. **Wait for confirmation** - Transactions need 1-2 block confirmations
2. **Refresh the browser** - Force reload the page (Ctrl+F5)
3. **Check transaction** - Verify it succeeded on the block explorer
4. **Reconnect wallet** - Disconnect and reconnect your wallet

### My health factor is getting low

If your health factor is approaching dangerous levels:

1. **Add more collateral** - Deposit additional assets immediately
2. **Reduce debt** - Repay some borrowed assets
3. **Partial withdrawal** - Reduce your position size
4. **Monitor markets** - Watch for price movements affecting your position
