## Getting Started

### How do I get started with Amber Finance?

Start with our **[Getting Started guide](/user-guide/getting_started)** which covers:

- Connecting your wallet
- Understanding the platform
- Finding yield opportunities
- Next steps for depositing and strategies

### What is Amber Finance?

Amber Finance is a Bitcoin yield farming platform built on the Cosmos ecosystem. It enables Bitcoin holders to earn yields through Bitcoin-Related Tokens (BRTs), leverage strategies, and protocol lending. Users can deposit Bitcoin BRTs like LBTC, solvBTC, uniBTC, and others to earn combined yields from both protocol lending and underlying points campaigns.

### How do I generate yield on Amber Finance?

You can generate yield through multiple strategies:

- **Protocol lending**: Earn interest by depositing your Bitcoin BRTs to enable looping strategies
- **Points campaigns**: Additional rewards in native points and Mars Fragments as well as Neutron Points
- **Leverage strategies**: Amplify returns by BRTs against your maxBTC collateral

### Is Amber Finance safe?

Amber Finance prioritizes security through:

- **Battle-tested smart contracts** with extensive audits by Oak Security and Halborn
- **Health factor monitoring** to prevent liquidations
- **Diversified protocol exposure** to reduce single-point-of-failure risks
- **Transparent operations** on the Neutron blockchain
- **Isolated market architecture** to reduce contagion risk

However, like all DeFi protocols, there are inherent risks including smart contract vulnerabilities, liquidation risks, and market volatility.

### What are the fees?

Amber Finance charges minimal fees:

- **No deposit/withdrawal fees** - only network gas costs
- **Protocol fees**: Small percentage of earned yields (10%)
- **Gas fees**: Standard Neutron network fees (very low, usually less than $0.01)
- **Swap fees**: 5 basis points (0.05%) for BRT swaps
- **No hidden fees** - all costs are transparent and displayed upfront

## Using the Platform

### How do I connect my wallet?

Amber Finance supports multiple Cosmos wallets including Keplr, Leap, Cosmostation, OKX Wallet, Vectis, and XDEFI.

1. **Click "Connect Wallet"** in the top-right corner
2. **Choose your wallet**: Keplr, Leap, Cosmostation, OKX Wallet, Vectis, or XDEFI
3. **Approve the connection** in your wallet
4. **Switch to Neutron network** if prompted

Make sure you have some NTRN tokens for gas fees. For detailed instructions, see our [Getting Started guide](/user-guide/getting_started#connecting-your-wallet).

### How do I start earning yields?

1. **Browse opportunities** on the main dashboard
2. **Click on a token card** (e.g., LBTC, solvBTC)
3. **Deposit your BRTs** using our [depositing guide](/user-guide/depositing)
4. **Start earning immediately** - yields are calculated in real-time

For detailed steps, see our **[Depositing BRTs guide](/user-guide/depositing)**.

### How do leverage strategies work?

Leverage strategies use maxBTC to borrow additional BRTs. These BRTs are then swapped into maxBTC and deposited as collateral again. This amplifies your maxBTC yield.

**Important**: Higher returns come with higher risks. Monitor your health factor closely.

For detailed information, see our **[Strategy Guide](/strategies)**.

### What happens if I get liquidated?

If your health factor drops below 1.0:

1. **Partial liquidation** occurs to bring you back to safety
2. **Liquidation penalty** is applied (typically 5-10%)
3. **Your debt is reduced** by the amount liquidated
4. **Remaining position** continues earning yields

To avoid liquidation, monitor your health factor and add collateral or reduce debt when it gets low.

## Swapping & Portfolio Management

### How does the swap feature work?

The swap feature allows you to trade between different BRTs directly from your wallet.

1. **Select "From" and "To" tokens** from supported Bitcoin BRTs
2. **Enter the amount** you want to swap
3. **Review exchange rate** and slippage tolerance (0.1%, 0.5%, 1.0%)
4. **Confirm the transaction** - swaps execute instantly
5. **Minimal slippage** due to high correlation between Bitcoin assets

### How do I withdraw my assets?

To withdraw your deposited assets:

1. **Navigate to the specific token** page (e.g., LBTC)
2. **Switch to "Withdraw" tab**
3. **Enter withdrawal amount** or use percentage slider
4. **Review transaction** including accrued rewards
5. **Confirm withdrawal** - usually processes within 1-2 blocks

Withdrawals are typically instant.

### Can I withdraw partially?

Yes, you can withdraw any amount up to your available balance. The platform shows:

- **Total deposited amount**
- **Available for withdrawal**
- **Accrued rewards** that will be included in withdrawal

## Troubleshooting

### My transaction failed, what should I do?

Common solutions for failed transactions:

1. **Check gas balance** - Ensure you have NTRN for fees
2. **Verify network** - Confirm you're connected to Neutron
3. **Refresh the page** - Clear any cached data
4. **Increase gas limit** - Some complex transactions need more gas
5. **Try again** - Network congestion can cause temporary failures

### I can't see my balance after depositing

If your balance doesn't appear:

1. **Wait for confirmation** - Transactions need 1-2 block confirmations
2. **Refresh the browser** - Force reload the page (Ctrl+F5)
3. **Check transaction** - Verify it succeeded on the block explorer
4. **Reconnect wallet** - Disconnect and reconnect your wallet

### I'm getting "Insufficient funds" errors

This usually means:

1. **Not enough NTRN** for gas fees - add some NTRN to your wallet
2. **Insufficient BRT balance** - check your wallet balance
3. **Network issues** - try switching networks and back
4. **Wallet sync issues** - refresh your wallet connection

### The app is loading slowly

Try these solutions:

1. **Clear browser cache** and refresh the page
2. **Check your internet connection**
3. **Try a different browser** (Chrome recommended)
4. **Disable browser extensions** that might interfere
5. **Make sure hardware acceleration is enabled** in browser
