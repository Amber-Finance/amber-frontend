# Governance

Amber Finance is currently steered by a [Multisig DAO on Neutron](https://daodao.zone/dao/neutron1ld67026gdnq4x2uyddhcdrtesxh0sypummyv9hsslm8es8yej8fqct70qj/home).  
This multisig structure is responsible for making operational and strategic decisions, including protocol upgrades, parameter adjustments, and treasury management.

The DAO treasury is fully transparent and viewable on-chain, allowing anyone to audit asset holdings, transactions, and historical activity.

> **Note:** There is **no Amber Finance governance token** (such as “AMBER”) live at this time. Governance decisions are not made through token voting but instead via multisig coordination among trusted signers.

All revenue generated by Amber Finance contributes directly to the **Mars Protocol balance sheet**, ensuring alignment with the broader Mars ecosystem.
