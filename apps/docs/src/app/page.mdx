## What is Amber Finance?

Amber Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform focused on unlocking yield for Bitcoin holders using **Bitcoin-Related Tokens (BRTs)**. These include tokenized or staked representations of BTC that can be used in DeFi without sacrificing exposure to Bitcoin itself.

Amber enables:

* Yield generation through protocol lending and native staking mechanisms
# Leveraged Points Farming
* Transparent and on-chain leverage, including **looping strategies**
* Seamless asset swaps across supported BRTs

Amber Finance operates under a [Multisig DAO on Neutron](https://daodao.zone/dao/neutron1ld67026gdnq4x2uyddhcdrtesxh0sypummyv9hsslm8es8yej8fqct70qj/home), where community members can view treasury holdings and transactions transparently on-chain.

> **Note:** All revenue generated by Amber Finance contributes to the Mars Protocol balance sheet, aligning incentives with the broader Mars ecosystem.
