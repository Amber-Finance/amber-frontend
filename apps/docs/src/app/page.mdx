# Amber Finance Documentation

Welcome to Amber Finance, the premier Bitcoin-native yield platform in the Cosmos ecosystem. Built on Neutron and powered by the audited [Mars Protocol smart contracts](https://github.com/mars-protocol/contracts), Amber enables sustainable Bitcoin yield strategies through a combination of depositing, looping, swapping, and composable DeFi infrastructure.

Whether you're a passive Bitcoin holder or an active DeFi strategist, Amber provides a streamlined way to earn, manage, and deploy your assets with confidence, all through Bitcoin-Related Tokens (BRT).

## Quick Start Guide

**Get started in 3 simple steps:**

1. **Connect Wallet** → Use [Keplr, Leap, or any Cosmos wallet](/user-guide/getting_started#connecting-your-wallet)
2. **Deposit BRTs** → Choose from [eBTC, LBTC, solvBTC, and more](/user-guide/depositing)
3. **Start Earning** → Earn yields immediately from [staking + points campaigns](/user-guide/points-campaigns)

**What you'll need:**

- A [Cosmos-compatible wallet](/user-guide/getting_started#connecting-your-wallet) (Keplr recommended)
- Some [NTRN tokens for gas fees](/user-guide/getting_started#prerequisites) (~$0.01 per transaction)
- [Bitcoin-related tokens (BRTs)](/user-guide/depositing) to deposit

## What is Amber Finance?

![Amber](/x-profile/banner.png)

Amber Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform focused on unlocking yield for Bitcoin holders using **Bitcoin-Related Tokens (BRTs)**. These include tokenized or staked representations of BTC that can be used in DeFi without sacrificing exposure to Bitcoin itself.

### What Amber Enables

- **Leveraged Yield Generation** through underlying staking mechanisms
- **Leveraged Points Farming** with Mars Fragments and Neutron Points
- **Transparent and On-Chain Leverage** including looping strategies with **up to 10x leverage**
- **Seamless Asset Swaps** across supported BRTs with minimal slippage

### Governance & Transparency

Amber Finance operates under a [Multisig DAO on Neutron](https://daodao.zone/dao/neutron1ld67026gdnq4x2uyddhcdrtesxh0sypummyv9hsslm8es8yej8fqct70qj/home), where community members can view treasury holdings and transactions transparently on-chain.

> **Note:** All revenue generated by Amber Finance contributes to the [Mars Protocol Foundation (MPF)](https://daodao.zone/dao/neutron1yv9veqnaxt3xwafnfdtr9r995m50ad6039lduux5huay6nhnef8sapq3zp), aligning incentives with the broader Mars ecosystem.

## What are Bitcoin-Related Tokens (BRTs)?

Bitcoin-Related Tokens (BRTs) are tokenized representations of Bitcoin that enable BTC holders to participate in DeFi activities while maintaining exposure to Bitcoin's price movements. These tokens bridge the gap between Bitcoin's store-of-value properties and the yield-generating opportunities available in decentralized finance.

### Key Characteristics of BRTs

**Bitcoin Exposure**: Each BRT maintains a 1:1 or near 1:1 relationship with Bitcoin's price, ensuring holders retain their BTC exposure.

**DeFi Compatibility**: Unlike native Bitcoin, BRTs can be easily integrated into DeFi protocols for lending, borrowing, yield farming, and other financial activities.

**Cross-Chain Functionality**: Many BRTs operate across multiple blockchain networks, enabling seamless movement between different DeFi ecosystems.

**Backed by Real Bitcoin**: Most BRTs are backed by actual Bitcoin reserves, providing intrinsic value and reducing counterparty risk.

### How BRTs Work

1. **Tokenization Process**: Bitcoin is locked in a secure vault or staking mechanism
2. **Token Generation**: An equivalent amount of BRT tokens are minted and distributed
3. **DeFi Integration**: These tokens can then be used across various DeFi protocols
4. **Redemption**: BRTs can typically be redeemed for the underlying Bitcoin (subject to protocol rules)

### Why BRTs Matter for DeFi

- **Capital Efficiency**: Bitcoin holders can earn yield without selling their BTC
- **Risk Management**: Diversified exposure across multiple Bitcoin-related protocols
- **Liquidity**: Enhanced trading and lending opportunities for Bitcoin assets
- **Innovation**: Enables new financial products and strategies for Bitcoin holders

Amber Finance aggregates these various BRTs, allowing users to access the best yield opportunities across the entire Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem through a single, unified platform.
