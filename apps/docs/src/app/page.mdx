## What is Amber Finance?

Amber Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform focused on unlocking yield for Bitcoin holders using **Bitcoin-Related Tokens (BRTs)**. These include tokenized or staked representations of BTC that can be used in DeFi without sacrificing exposure to Bitcoin itself.

Amber enables:

- **Yield Generation** - Protocol lending and native staking mechanisms
- **Leveraged Strategies** - Transparent on-chain leverage and looping strategies
- **Asset Swapping** - Seamless trades across supported BRTs
- **Points Farming** - Earn additional rewards through protocol participation

Amber Finance operates under a [Multisig DAO on Neutron](https://daodao.zone/dao/neutron1ld67026gdnq4x2uyddhcdrtesxh0sypummyv9hsslm8es8yej8fqct70qj/home), where community members can view treasury holdings and transactions transparently on-chain.

> **Note:** All revenue generated by Amber Finance contributes to the Mars Protocol balance sheet, aligning incentives with the broader Mars ecosystem.
