## Risk Framework Overview

Amber Finance does **not** implement the same risk framework or deposit caps used by Mars Protocol's default deployments.
This means there are **no deposit caps** in place â€” enabling _uncapped potential_ for liquidity providers and yield seekers.

### Key Differences from Mars Protocol

- **No deposit caps** - Unlimited liquidity provision opportunities
- **Flexible utilization** - Higher potential returns through increased capacity
- **User-driven risk management** - You control your exposure levels

## Platform Security Measures

Amber Finance is built on **battle-tested foundations** to ensure maximum security:

- **Forked from Mars Protocol Red Bank** - The most recognized lending framework in the Cosmos ecosystem
- **Audited smart contracts** - Verified for security and robustness by professional auditors
- **Developed by Mars Protocol contributors** - Deep familiarity with the underlying codebase
- **Isolated market architecture** - Reduces contagion risk between different BRT assets

## Your Responsibility

While Amber Finance provides robust security measures, **you are responsible for**:

- Understanding the risks before participating
- Managing your own exposure levels
- Monitoring your positions regularly
- Making informed decisions about your strategies
