# Risk Management

### Uncapped Potential with Maximum Security

Amber Finance does **not** implement the same risk framework or deposit caps used by Mars Protocol’s default deployments.  
This means there are **no deposit caps** in place — enabling *uncapped potential* for liquidity providers and yield seekers.

While Amber removes these caps to allow greater flexibility and higher potential returns, it is still built on **battle-tested foundations**:

- **Forked from the Mars Protocol Red Bank** — the most recognized lending framework in the Cosmos ecosystem  
- **Audited smart contracts**, verified for security and robustness  
- **Developed by Mars Protocol contributors**, ensuring deep familiarity with the underlying codebase  
- **Isolated market architecture** to reduce contagion risk between assets

> By combining uncapped opportunities with the security of audited, production-proven contracts, Amber Finance delivers maximum flexibility without compromising on safety.
