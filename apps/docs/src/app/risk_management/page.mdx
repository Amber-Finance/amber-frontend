# Risk Management

Understanding and managing risks is crucial when using DeFi protocols. This guide explains the risks associated with Amber Finance and how to mitigate them.

---

## Security Framework

### Uncapped Potential with Maximum Security

Amber Finance does **not** implement the same risk framework or deposit caps used by Mars Protocol's default deployments.  
This means there are **no deposit caps** in place, enabling _uncapped potential_ for liquidity providers and yield seekers.

## Risk Framework Overview

- **Forked from the Mars Protocol Red Bank**, the most recognized lending framework in the Cosmos ecosystem
- **Audited smart contracts**, verified for security and robustness by Oak Security and Halborn
- **Developed by Mars Protocol contributors**, ensuring deep familiarity with the underlying codebase
- **Isolated market architecture** to reduce contagion risk between assets

### Key Differences from Mars Protocol

You can review the underlying Mars Protocol contracts and audits here: [Mars Protocol Documentation](https://github.com/mars-protocol/mars-audits).

## Understanding DeFi Risks

### Smart Contract Risk

**What it is**: The risk that smart contracts contain bugs or vulnerabilities that could lead to loss of funds.

**Amber's mitigation**:

- Audited by Oak Security and Halborn
- Forked from battle-tested Mars Protocol contracts
- Open-source code for community review
- Gradual deployment with testing phases

### Liquidation Risk

**What it is**: The risk that your position gets liquidated if your health factor drops below 1.0.

**How to manage**:

- Monitor health factor regularly
- Keep health factor above 1.5 for safety
- Have reserves to add collateral if needed
- Understand liquidation parameters for each asset

### Market Risk

**What it is**: The risk that asset prices move against your position, affecting your collateral value.

**How to manage**:

- Diversify across multiple BRTs
- Don't over-leverage your positions
- Monitor market conditions
- Have exit strategies planned

### Protocol Risk

**What it is**: The risk that underlying BRT protocols fail or experience issues.

**How to manage**:

- Research underlying protocols
- Diversify across different BRT providers
- Monitor protocol health and updates
- Don't put all funds in one protocol

## Health Factor Management

### Understanding Health Factor

Health factor (HF) is the primary risk metric in Amber Finance:

- **Above 2.0**: Very safe, can increase leverage
- **1.5 - 2.0**: Safe operating range
- **1.3 - 1.5**: Caution zone, monitor closely
- **1.2 - 1.3**: Danger zone, reduce leverage immediately
- **Below 1.2**: Liquidation risk, take immediate action

### Health Factor Formula

```
Health Factor = Total Collateral Value / Total Debt Value
```

### How to Improve Health Factor

1. **Add more collateral** - Deposit additional assets
2. **Reduce debt** - Repay borrowed assets
3. **Wait for price appreciation** - If collateral prices increase
4. **Avoid high leverage** - Keep leverage ratios conservative

## Risk Management Strategies

### Conservative Strategy (Low Risk)

**Target APY**: 2-5%
**Leverage**: 1.2x - 2x
**Health Factor Target**: Above 2.0
**Best for**: Beginners, risk-averse users

**Strategy**:

- Focus on established BRTs (LBTC, uniBTC)
- Low leverage ratios
- Regular monitoring
- Diversified positions

### Balanced Strategy (Medium Risk)

**Target APY**: 4-8%
**Leverage**: 2x - 5x
**Health Factor Target**: Above 1.5
**Best for**: Experienced DeFi users

**Strategy**:

- Mix of established and newer BRTs
- Moderate leverage
- Active monitoring
- Risk management protocols

### High Yield Strategy (High Risk)

**Target APY**: 6-12%
**Leverage**: 5x - 10x
**Health Factor Target**: Above 1.3
**Best for**: Advanced users with high risk tolerance

**Strategy**:

- Higher leverage ratios
- Newer BRT protocols
- Very active monitoring
- Sophisticated risk management

## Emergency Procedures

### If Your Health Factor is Low

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Add more collateral immediately
   - Reduce debt by repaying borrowed assets
   - Consider partial withdrawal to reduce exposure

2. **If Health Factor < 1.2**:
   - Take immediate action to avoid liquidation
   - Consider emergency withdrawal
   - Contact support if needed

### If You Get Liquidated

1. **What happens**:
   - Partial liquidation occurs
   - Liquidation penalty applied (5-10%)
   - Health factor restored to 1.1
   - Remaining position continues

2. **Recovery**:
   - Assess what went wrong
   - Rebuild position gradually
   - Implement better risk management
   - Learn from the experience

## Best Practices

### Before You Start

- **Understand the risks** - Read all documentation
- **Start small** - Begin with conservative strategies
- **Test with small amounts** - Learn the platform first
- **Have a plan** - Know your risk tolerance and goals

### Ongoing Management

- **Monitor regularly** - Check positions daily
- **Set alerts** - Use notifications for health factor warnings
- **Keep reserves** - Maintain emergency funds
- **Stay informed** - Follow protocol updates and news

### Portfolio Management

- **Diversify** - Don't put everything in one asset
- **Rebalance** - Adjust positions as needed
- **Document** - Keep records of your strategies
- **Review** - Regularly assess your risk management

## Risk Assessment Tools

### Health Factor Calculator

Monitor your health factor in real-time on the dashboard. The platform provides:

- Real-time health factor updates
- Liquidation price alerts
- Position monitoring tools
- Risk visualization

### Risk Metrics

Key metrics to monitor:

- **Collateral Utilization**: How much of your collateral is being used
- **Debt Ratio**: Your total debt relative to collateral
- **Liquidation Price**: Price at which liquidation occurs
- **Available Liquidity**: How much you can borrow
