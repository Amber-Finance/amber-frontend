# Strategy Guide

Advanced guide to leverage strategies, risk management, and yield optimization on Amber Finance.

## Understanding Leverage Strategies

Leverage strategies allow you to amplify your Bitcoin yields by borrowing assets against your collateral. Amber Finance offers pre-built strategies designed for different risk appetites.

### How Leverage Works

1. **Deposit collateral** (e.g., MAXBTC)
2. **Borrow correlated assets** (e.g., other Bitcoin LSTs)
3. **Earn yields** on both positions
4. **Net profit** = (Collateral yield × leverage) - (Debt cost × leverage factor)

### Strategy Categories

### Risk Management

- **Maximum leverage**: 5x
- **Stop-loss trigger**: Health factor below 1.3
- **Rebalancing frequency**: Bi-weekly
- **Correlation monitoring**: Watch for LST correlation spikes

## High Yield Pursuit Strategy (6-12% APY)

### Overview

- **Risk Level**: High
- **Target Users**: Advanced users with high risk tolerance
- **Leverage Range**: 5x - 10x
- **Health Factor Target**: Above 1.3

### Recommended Assets

- **pumpBTC** (Pump Protocol) - High yield potential
- **eBTC** (Edge Protocol) - Emerging protocol with strong yields
- **FBTC** (Future protocols) - Early access opportunities

### High-Risk Features

- **Maximum yield potential** through aggressive leverage
- **Early protocol access** to capture first-mover advantages
- **Higher volatility** requiring active management
- **Active management** with frequent monitoring

### Implementation Steps

1. **Start small** with 5-10% of portfolio
2. **Focus on newest protocols** with highest yields
3. **Monitor closely** with daily health factor checks
4. **Scale up gradually** as comfort level increases

### Risk Management

- **Maximum leverage**: 10x (experienced users only)
- **Stop-loss trigger**: Health factor below 1.2
- **Rebalancing frequency**: Daily monitoring, weekly rebalancing
- **Position limits**: Maximum 15% per protocol

## Risk Management Framework

### Health Factor Monitoring

#### Health Factor Ranges

- **Above 2.0**: Very safe, can increase leverage
- **1.5 - 2.0**: Safe operating range
- **1.3 - 1.5**: Caution zone, monitor closely
- **1.2 - 1.3**: Danger zone, reduce leverage
- **Below 1.2**: Liquidation risk, immediate action required

#### Monitoring Tools

- **Real-time dashboard** with health factor alerts
- **Mobile notifications** for threshold breaches
- **Automated rebalancing** options (coming soon)
- **Historical tracking** for performance analysis

### Liquidation Protection

#### Prevention Strategies

1. **Maintain buffer**: Keep health factor above 1.5
2. **Diversify collateral**: Use multiple LST types
3. **Monitor correlations**: Watch for market-wide moves
4. **Set alerts**: Get notified before reaching danger zones

#### Emergency Procedures

1. **Immediate assessment**: Check current health factor
2. **Add collateral**: Deposit more assets if available
3. **Reduce debt**: Repay borrowed assets
4. **Partial liquidation**: Close portion of position
5. **Full exit**: Complete position closure if necessary

### Portfolio Diversification

#### Protocol Diversification

- **Never exceed 40%** in any single protocol
- **Spread across 3-5 protocols** minimum
- **Monitor protocol health** and governance changes
- **Stay updated** on audit reports and security

#### Asset Diversification

- **Core holdings** (50-60%): LBTC, uniBTC
- **Growth assets** (30-40%): solvBTC, wBTC
- **Speculative** (10-20%): pumpBTC, eBTC

## Advanced Strategies

### Yield Arbitrage

#### Concept

Exploit yield differences between similar assets by:

1. **Borrowing lower-yield assets**
2. **Lending higher-yield assets**
3. **Capturing the spread**

#### Example

- Borrow wBTC at 3% APY
- Lend solvBTC at 7% APY
- Net yield: 4% (minus fees and slippage)

### Delta-Neutral Strategies

#### Concept

Maintain price exposure neutral while earning yields:

1. **Long position** in one Bitcoin LST
2. **Short position** in correlated asset
3. **Earn yields** on both sides

#### Implementation

- Use Amber Finance for long positions
- Use external platforms for shorting
- Monitor basis risk between assets

### Automated Rebalancing

#### Trigger Conditions

- **Health factor** drops below threshold
- **Yield spreads** change significantly
- **Time-based** rebalancing (weekly/monthly)
- **Volatility spikes** require position adjustments

#### Rebalancing Actions

- **Adjust leverage** up or down
- **Rotate between assets** based on performance
- **Take profits** when targets are reached
- **Cut losses** when stop-losses are hit

## Performance Tracking

### Key Metrics

#### Return Metrics

- **Total return** (capital + yield)
- **APY achieved** vs. target
- **Sharpe ratio** (return per unit risk)
- **Maximum drawdown** during adverse periods

#### Risk Metrics

- **Health factor** minimum/average
- **Liquidation events** (should be zero)
- **Correlation exposure** to Bitcoin price
- **Protocol concentration** risk

### Reporting Tools

#### Dashboard Features

- **Real-time P&L** tracking
- **Performance attribution** by asset/strategy
- **Risk metrics** visualization
- **Historical performance** charts

#### Export Options

- **CSV reports** for tax purposes
- **Performance summaries** for analysis
- **Risk reports** for compliance
- **Transaction history** detailed logs
