## Understanding Your Earnings

### Real-Time Yield Calculation

Your earnings are calculated and updated every block (~5 seconds):

**Base Yield** = Staking rewards from the underlying BRT protocol  
**Points Yield** = Mars Fragments + Neutron Points from campaigns  
**Total Yield** = Base Yield + Points Yield

### Example: LBTC Deposit

If you deposit 1 LBTC worth $95,000:

- **Staking APY**: 2.5% = ~$2,375/year
- **Points Multiplier**: 4× = Additional rewards
- **Total Potential**: ~$10,000/year in combined yields
