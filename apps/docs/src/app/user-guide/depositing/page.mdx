## Steps to Deposit

1. **Connect your wallet** - Use Keplr, Leap, Cosmostation, OKX, Vectis, or XDEFI
2. **Switch to Neutron network** - Ensure you're connected to the correct network
3. **Select your BRT** - Choose from the dashboard cards (solvBTC, LBTC, uniBTC, etc.)
4. **Enter deposit amount** - Type the amount or use the slider for percentage-based input
5. **Review transaction** - Check the amount, fees, and transaction details
6. **Confirm deposit** - Approve the transaction in your wallet

Your deposit will start earning its underlying yield and points immediately, though it may take a few blocks to appear in the UI.

## Understanding the Dashboard

The main dashboard displays all available Bitcoin yield opportunities as individual cards, each showing:

- **Asset information** - BRT symbol (like solvBTC) and protocol name
- **Current APY** - Prominently displayed yield rate (e.g., 1.53%)
- **Utilization metrics** - Protocol utilization rate and TVL share
- **Points campaigns** - Available rewards (Solv Points, Neutron Points, Mars Fragments)
- **Your balances** - Deposited and available amounts for each BRT
- **Action buttons** - Deposit and withdraw options

### Understanding the Cards

Each BRT card displays key information to help you make informed decisions:

- **Current APY** – The total yield rate prominently shown (combines all reward sources)
- **Utilization Rate** – How much of the protocol's capacity is currently in use
- **TVL Share** – The protocol's share of total platform deposits
- **Points Rewards** – Additional rewards from campaigns (shown as tags like "Solv Points 4x")
- **Balance Overview** – Clear view of your deposited vs. available amounts

## Withdrawals

You can withdraw your deposited assets anytime, as long as the utilization rate is below 100%. Withdrawals are processed within 1–2 Neutron blocks.

> **Tip:** There are no deposit caps on Amber Finance to ensure you can put all your BRTs to work.
