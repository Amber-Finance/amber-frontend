# Depositing BRTs

Depositing Bitcoin-Related Tokens (BRTs) into Amber Finance allows you to put your assets to work immediately.

When you deposit, your BRTs:

- Remain in your control as collateral  
- Continue earning their underlying staking rewards
- Start earning Mars Fragments and Neutron Points (Points Campaigns) 
- Can be used to borrow other BRTs for looping strategies
- Can be used to swap to another BRT

### Steps to Deposit

1. Connect your wallet (Keplr, Leap, Cosmostation, OKX, Vectis, XDEFI).
2. Ensure you’re on the Neutron network.
3. Select the BRT you wish to deposit from the dashboard.
4. Enter the amount you’d like to deposit, or use the slider to choose a percentage.
5. Review your transaction details, including initial Health Factor (HF).
6. Confirm the transaction in your wallet.

Your deposit will start earning its underlying yield & points immediately but won't be visibile on the UI until the integartion is completed.

### Withdrawals

You can withdraw your deposited assets anytime, as long as the utilization rate is below 100%. Withdrawals are processed within 1–2 Neutron blocks.

**Tip:** There are no deposit caps on Amber Finance to ensure you can put all your BRTs to work.
