## Strategy Guide

A guide to using leverage strategies (“looping”) to maximize your Bitcoin-related token (BRT) yields on Amber Finance.

## Understanding Leverage Strategies

Looping lets you **amplify the staking yield of maxBTC** by borrowing BRTs against your maxBTC collateral and redeploying it into more yield-bearing maxBTC — repeatedly — to multiply your exposure.

Amber offers pre-configured loops ranging from **conservative 1.1×** to **high-octane 8.3×**, each with different Health Factor (HF) safety buffers.

## How Looping Works

1. **Deposit maxBTC collateral**
2. **Borrow any supported BRT** — e.g., LBTC, solvBTC, pumpBTC.
3. **Swap** borrowed assets into maxBTC (5 bps swap fee).
4. **Repeat** until you reach your target leverage and HF.
5. **Earn yield** on the full leveraged position.

### Example: maxBTC - LBTC Yield Amplification

* **maxBTC Yield**: 12% APY
* **LBTC Borrow Rate**: 2.5%
* **Initial deposit**: \$10,000 maxBTC
* **Target leverage**: 3×
* **Effective position size**: \$30,000 maxBTC equivalent
* **Effective debt size**: \$20,000 LBTC
* **Gross yield**: (12% × 3) -(2.5% x 2) = **31% APY**
