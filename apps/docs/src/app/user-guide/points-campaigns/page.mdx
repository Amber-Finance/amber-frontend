# Points Campaigns

Amber Finance offers various **Points Campaigns** that provide additional yield opportunities beyond traditional staking rewards. These campaigns distribute tokens like **Mars Fragments** and **Neutron Rewards** to users who participate in specific yield strategies.

---

## Understanding Points Campaigns

Points Campaigns are incentive programs that reward users with additional tokens for participating in specific DeFi activities. In Amber Finance, these campaigns enhance your total APY by providing:

- **Mars Fragments (\$MARS)** – Native tokens from the Mars Protocol ecosystem
- **Neutron Rewards (\$NTRN)** – Governance tokens from the Neutron network
- **Additional yield** on top of your underlying Bitcoin LST staking rewards

Some campaigns also feature **multipliers**, meaning your point accrual rate is boosted depending on the product:

- **4× multiplier** – SolvBTC, LBTC
- **3× multiplier** – eBTC, uniBTC
- **TBC multiplier** – WBTC, maxBTC

### How Points Work

1. **Automatic Participation** – When you [deposit into supported Bitcoin LSTs](/user-guide/depositing), you automatically become eligible for relevant points campaigns
2. **Real-time Accumulation** – Points accumulate based on your deposit amount, time held, and applicable multiplier
3. **APY Enhancement** – Points campaigns significantly boost your total yield potential

## Available Points Campaigns

Amber Finance offers points campaigns across all supported Bitcoin LSTs. Each Bitcoin LST provides access to multiple points campaigns simultaneously, maximizing your earning potential.

### Universal Points Campaigns

All Bitcoin LST products on Amber Finance earn two universal point types that provide additional yield beyond traditional staking rewards.

### Product-Specific Points Campaigns

Each Bitcoin LST product offers unique additional points on top of the universal campaigns, with varying multipliers that enhance your earning potential.

### Points Calculation

Your points accumulation depends on several factors:

- **Protocol Activity** – Additional interactions can boost point rates

Note:
- Neutron Points for strategies are calculated only on equity (the user’s own capital in the strategy).
