# Points Campaigns

Amber Finance offers various **Points Campaigns** that provide additional yield opportunities beyond traditional staking rewards. These campaigns distribute tokens like **Mars Fragments** and **Neutron Points** to users who participate in specific yield strategies.

---

## Understanding Points Campaigns

Points Campaigns are incentive programs that reward users with additional tokens for participating in specific DeFi activities. In Amber Finance, these campaigns enhance your total APY by providing:

- **Mars Fragments (\$MARS)** – Native tokens from the Mars Protocol ecosystem
- **Neutron Points (\$NTRN)** – Governance tokens from the Neutron network
- **Additional yield** on top of your underlying BRT staking rewards

Some campaigns also feature **multipliers**, meaning your point accrual rate is boosted depending on the product:

- **4× multiplier** – SolvBTC, LBTC
- **3× multiplier** – eBTC, uniBTC
- **TBC multiplier** – WBTC, maxBTC

### How Points Work

1. **Automatic Participation** – When you [deposit into supported BRTs](/user-guide/depositing), you automatically become eligible for relevant points campaigns
2. **Real-time Accumulation** – Points accumulate based on your deposit amount, time held, and applicable multiplier
3. **APY Enhancement** – Points campaigns significantly boost your total yield potential

### Universal Points Campaigns

All BRT products on Amber Finance earn two universal point types that provide additional yield beyond traditional staking rewards.
