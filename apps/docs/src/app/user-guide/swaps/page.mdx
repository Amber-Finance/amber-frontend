# Swapping BRTs

Swapping BRTs on Amber refers to the direct exchange of one asset for another using the funds already available in a user's wallet. It does not involve leverage, borrowing, or margin mechanics.
Users simply swap an asset (e.g., WBTC for LBTC) at the current market rate.
All trades are executed through integrated decentralized exchanges (DEXs).
No risk of liquidation exists, as the trade only involves assets the user already owns.
This mechanism mirrors conventional DEX trading but benefits from Mars’ unified collateral model and smooth interface.
